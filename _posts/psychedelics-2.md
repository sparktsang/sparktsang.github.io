The next day, as I passed his bunk, Ade greeted me warmly. I expected a fleeting hello, but the conversation that followed lasted another hour, unlocking yet another, deeper layer of his parallel reality.

It began with a simple question. "How are you doing?" he asked, then added, "I see you stay up late."

"Yes," I replied, a little self-consciously, "the nights are quiet. Good for thinking and writing." I felt a slight pang of guilt, knowing that he had been the subject of my writing the night before. Thankfully, he had no interest in what I was thinking or writing about.

The conversation, as I had hoped, quickly circled back to him. I asked where he usually ate, noticing he rarely seemed to leave the room. His answer, delivered with a calm simplicity, opened a door to a new world.

"I only eat fruits now," he said.

The statement hung in the air. I looked at the strange, unfamiliar fruit sitting on his table and tried to imagine it. A life without restaurants, without cooked food. My mind flashed back to an old man I'd met years ago in Ipoh, Malaysia. He too was a fruitarian, a man so painfully thin he was almost skeletal. But what I remembered most was the stark, unforgettable contrast between his emaciated frame and the burning, unwavering clarity in his eyes. He radiated the serene aura of a seasoned meditator, and he had told me the same thing: "Cooked food makes you tired. It takes all your energy to digest. When you only eat fruit, you feel alive."

His eyes had told me he believed it with every fiber of his being. But even then, a quiet doubt had pricked at my mind: did the clarity come from the diet, or from the meditation? Was he making a false attribution? I never pursued the question back then.

And now, here I was again, faced with another fruit-eating meditator. The old question returned, but this time with a new, more urgent weight. Is this a health choice, or is it something more?
