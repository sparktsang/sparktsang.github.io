"The Body and the System"

He was a ghost in my periphery for nine days before he became a person. His name was Tshepo, a South African man. Our first encounter was a miniature thriller in itself. I was scouting the guesthouse, not yet a resident, when he greeted me in the tiny lobby. We exchanged names, countries. Standard traveler stuff. And then, on his third sentence, he made a request so bizarre, so out of sync with the normal rules of engagement, that it left me momentarily speechless.

He had a friend in Beijing, he explained, who was trying to send him money. Seeing that I was from Hong Kong, he figured I might be the solution. Could I, a complete stranger, act as the middleman—receive the funds and then pass the cash to him?

I furrowed my brow, a wave of moral calculus and suspicion washing over me. The request was a red flag the size of a planet. But he asked with such a calm, matter-of-fact sincerity. I deflected with a practical problem: the financial systems were different. I put the ball back in his court, suggesting he ask his friend about the right channels. "Okay," he said, undeterred.

Two days later, I checked in. He was still there, in the same spot. "My friend hasn't replied yet," he updated me, as if we were partners in an ongoing venture. Seeing that he was a long-term resident, I asked for a restaurant recommendation; he gave me one, and I gave him one in return.

After a decent 50-baht chicken fried rice at his recommended spot, I returned. He was still there. I told him the food was good and asked if he'd try my place. "Tomorrow," he said. "Does it do takeaway?" Strange, I thought. The place was a one-minute walk away. "I have things to sort out here," he explained vaguely, "so I mostly get takeaway."

My suspicion deepened. "Why are you always *here*?" I asked, my curiosity overriding politeness. "Are you working?"

"No," he said, his expression unreadable. "Just... sorting things out." As he spoke, he walked behind the reception counter with an air of belonging and picked up several parcels. "From friends," he offered.

"So you're traveling? Or working?" I pressed again.

"Traveling," he insisted.

He was a walking riddle. A man who dressed well but needed to figure out a cross-border money transfer with a stranger. A man who was "traveling" but never seemed to leave the hostel lobby. A man who needed takeaway for a restaurant a stone's throw away. What was he sorting out? What was in those parcels? My mind filled with possibilities, none of them savory. A wall went up between us.

Over the following days, I would see him. Sometimes he was engrossed in a book in that same lobby seat. Once, I saw him in the 7-Eleven, wearing dark sunglasses, an impenetrable mask. I never knew if he saw me. We exchanged no greetings. He was a puzzle I had decided was too complicated, too risky, to solve.

Then, last night, near midnight, I was working in the dark, cavernous common area. Two shadowy figures were sitting a few meters away. One of them called out to me, asking if I was from Hong Kong. "How did you know?" I asked. He pointed to the other shadow. "He told me." It was Tshepo. We exchanged another polite, distant greeting. A faint possibility of connection flickered in the darkness, then vanished. He knew I was there. He remembered me. And he was still here.

The riddle of Tshepo remained unsolved, a low-frequency hum of mystery in the background of my Krabi life. Until today, in the shared bathroom, when the final, devastating piece of the puzzle was about to be revealed.


Then, today, I met him in the shared bathroom. "My friend still hasn't replied," he said again, a recurring line in a story I didn't yet know. Then, he delivered the line that changed everything.

"Do you have 20 or 30 baht I could have?" he asked, his voice soft, almost apologetic. "For some noodles. It's totally okay if not."

"Let me think about whether I can help," I said, a coward's answer to buy myself a moment. "I'll be around here," he replied, and sat down in the lobby, a portrait of patient desperation.

Walking to lunch, my mind was not my own. It had become a courtroom, a battlefield where four distinct voices, four aspects of myself, waged a furious war over a single, 30-baht question.

The first to speak was **The Hong Kong Skeptic**, a voice forged in a city of scams. *"Obvious con,"* he sneered. *"This is the long game. The nine-day grooming process, the parcels, the sob story—it's all a setup. Today it's 30 baht, tomorrow it's 300. Don't be a fool."*

But a second voice, **The Pragmatist**, countered immediately. *"The logic is flawed,"* he argued, his tone clipped and efficient. *"Nine days of meticulous planning for the price of a cup of coffee? The ROI is pathetic. The probability of a scam is low. The real issue isn't the truth; it's the precedent. Once you open the floodgates of charity, you become a resource. He needs to eat every day. Can you sustain this? Will you become his personal ATM?"*

Then, a third, more insidious voice emerged. **The Exploiter**, the cold-blooded capitalist. *"You're both missing the opportunity here,"* he whispered, his voice smooth and seductive. *"The Pragmatist is right; charity is unsustainable. But this isn't a problem; it's an asset. The man is desperate. His time is worthless on the open market. We need traffic for the website. We can buy his entire day's labor for the price of a few meals. Let's make him an offer. A perfect, win-win value exchange. He gets to eat, we get an army of one to seed links in African forums. It's the only logical, mutually beneficial solution."*

The three voices debated, their arguments circling each other, each one rational, each one cold. And as they fought, a fourth voice, one that had been silent until now, finally spoke. **The Empath**.

His argument was not an argument at all. It was an image.

An image of a man, out of money, in a foreign land. What would that feel like? Would I hitchhike to the embassy in Bangkok? Would I stand in a food court, waiting for someone to leave their leftovers, and then pounce on the scraps like a stray dog? Would I scrawl my desperation on a piece of cardboard and beg on a street corner? *I don't know.* The thought was terrifying, a black hole of humiliation and despair.

The Empath then painted another image: a man who, he claimed, had not eaten all day, while I was on my way to a full meal.

And with that, the war was over.

The Skeptic's argument collapsed under the sheer improbability of the con. The Pragmatist's concerns about the future felt like a cowardly excuse for inaction in the present. And The Exploiter's "perfect solution" was revealed for what it was: a monstrous, predatory act dressed in the language of efficiency.

The Empath had won, not by out-arguing the others, but by appealing to a logic older and deeper than all of them.

The moral calculus, in the end, was simple and brutal. I walked into a "Super Cheap" minimart and bought a cup of noodles. It cost 12 baht—an almost meaningless sum of money that could stave off a man's hunger.


When I returned, he was still sitting in the small public space by the reception. "How are you doing?" I asked. He looked down at the floor for a long moment before raising his head, a strained smile on his face. "Yes, I'm fine." I felt the receptionist's presence nearby and suspected this wasn't a conversation he'd want to have in front of her. "Let's take a walk down the corridor," I suggested.

Away from prying eyes, I asked again. "Have you eaten today?"
"Not yet," he said.
"How do you manage?"
"Water. Fasting."
"Is it really just the friend in Beijing?" I probed gently. "No other network?"
"I'm asking other friends," he replied, his voice quiet.

The moment had come. "I happen to have a cup of noodles," I said, trying to make it sound as casual as possible. "I'm not sure if it's your taste, but do you want it?" His face lit up with a relief so pure it was painful to watch. "Yes, please."

I handed it to him and retreated, saying I needed the bathroom, giving him space. When I came back out, I saw a scene that will be forever burned into my memory. He was standing outside the hostel bar, facing the staff member who was sitting leisurely behind the counter. He, the guest, was standing, waiting, while she, the employee, sat, unhurried, preparing his meal. In the upside-down world of a struggling traveler, even the simple act of receiving sustenance becomes an exercise in humility. The urgency of his hunger, forcing him to stand and watch, was a silent testament to the vast power imbalance between them.

I went to my room to collect myself. When I re-emerged, I found him in the furthest, darkest corner of the lobby, eating. It was real. This was his first meal of the day. I approached him, my every move now weighed down by this chasm between us. He told me, the noodles was "good". Another wave of sadness hit me. I couldn't remember the last time I'd eaten instant noodles; it was a food of no consequence to me. 

"Can I sit here?" I asked, a question he was in no position to refuse. Was my politeness a comfort, or was its very artifice a sting? I didn't know. The war in my head, which I thought had ended, had just begun a new campaign. The Empath had won the battle of the noodle cup, but now **The Exploiter** saw a new opportunity. *"We need stories,"* he whispered. *"He has one. A hundred baht for his story. It's a win-win. He eats for a few more days, we get our material."* Could I do it? Could I put a price on a man's dignity?

No. The Empath, though weakened, barely won. I chose a different path. "I have started to write during my travels," I began. "I want to tell people's stories. I was hoping you might let me tell yours. Sometimes, just thinking out loud, telling your own story, can give you a new perspective in a way you don't expect."

"Okay," he said. I couldn't tell if he genuinely liked the idea, or if he simply couldn't refuse the man who had just given him his only meal.

As he began to speak, I noticed the loud music coming from a speaker directly above his chosen corner. "It's too noisy, I can't hear you," I said, suggesting we move. He agreed, but as he stood up, his expression was not one of happiness. Had he chosen this dark corner for a reason? To be invisible? And here I was, in my quest for connection, unintentionally forcing him out into a more open, more brightly-lit space, where he could be seen, and judged.

We moved. He spoke softly, and I had to pull my chair closer to hear his story. We were two men, struggling. He was struggling for survival, and I, against a rising tide of my own complicated motives, was struggling, simply, to do the right thing.
