After writing the story of [my encounter with Sandeep](https://sparktsang.github.io/life/2025/09/22/three-walls.html), the Indian programmer, I felt a sense of completion. I had taken a fleeting human connection and forged it into something lasting, a digital monument to our brief conversation about the architecture of freedom. A natural, almost instinctual, thought followed: I should share it with him.

It felt like the right thing to do, an act of respect. Our exchange had been one of ideas, a meeting of minds. To immortalize that dialogue in an essay was, I felt, a tribute to his intelligence. I drafted a message in my head, framing the piece not as a simple record, but as a testament to our shared moment in time, a philosophical exploration inspired by our talk.

But as my finger hovered over the "send" button, a different face flashed in my mind: [Neung](https://sparktsang.github.io/life/2025/09/16/02-man-from-nowhere.html). The kind, troubled, unemployed man I had met in Surat Thani, who had so generously shared his world with me. I had written about him, too, crafting his story of struggle and dignity into what I felt was a moving portrait of resilience.

Should I send it to him as well?

The question stopped me cold. And in the ensuing internal debate, the entire ethical foundation of my writing began to tremble.

Sharing with Sandeep felt like a continuation of our dialogue. He was a programmer, a digital native. He would understand the concepts of a "website," a "digital monument." He was my peer. But Neung? He might not even know how to use Agoda. He lived in a different world, one navigated by personal connections and word-of-mouth, not algorithms. To him, what would an essay on a foreigner's website even mean?

The content, too, was profoundly different. The article about Sandeep was a philosophical discussion where he was an equal participant. The article about Neung, however, derived its power from revealing his vulnerability—the quiet fictions he told to maintain his dignity, like the photo of a nice room he wasn't actually staying in. My writing was empathetic, but it was also invasive. For him to read it might not feel like an honor, but a betrayal. He might see not a compassionate portrait, but a foreigner who had taken his pain and turned it into content.

The decision became clear. To share the story with Sandeep was an exchange of ideas. To remain silent with Neung was a necessary act of protection, a deeper form of empathy.

And so, I sent the message to Sandeep. I waited. And then, the two blue ticks appeared, followed by... nothing. He had read it. And he had no reply.

The silence was deafening. It wasn't anger or rejection; it was something far more complex and unsettling. I tried to see my writing through his eyes. He, a man shackled by the tangible walls of a weak passport and the precariousness of a gig economy, reading the words of a man with near-total freedom who philosophized about abstract systems. My "profound insights" might have just sounded like the privileged complaints of someone who had never faced a real wall in his life. My story, meant as a tribute, might have felt like a cruel mirror, reflecting not our shared condition, but the unbridgeable chasm between us. The silence was not empty; it was filled with a poignant, five-thousand-mile stare.

And in that moment of silence, the entire architecture of my project collapsed. I finally saw the tragic, inverted pyramid I had built.

At the bottom, the very foundation, are the people I most want to reach, the people my [revolutionary ideas](https://sparktsang.github.io/philosophy.html) are supposed to liberate. People like Neung. Their reaction? Incomprehension, maybe even resentment. My words are a foreign language discussing problems they feel in their bones but cannot articulate in my theoretical terms.

In the middle are people like Sandeep. They are educated enough to understand the critique, yet so enmeshed in the system's daily struggles that my grand theories are a painful reminder of their own powerlessness. My writing isn't a call to arms for them; it's just a more eloquent description of their prison cell. Their response is a heavy, complicated silence.

And at the very top, the smallest, most powerful tip of the pyramid, are the people who will truly resonate with my work. The academics, the successful artists, the visionary entrepreneurs—the very architects, managers, and greatest beneficiaries of the systems I critique. They will probably applaud the insights, praise the literary style, and share the articles within their own elite echo chambers. They are the system-hackers, the ones who already see the world as a flawed code to be rewritten. My work doesn't challenge them; it validates them.

This is the echo chamber dilemma of a revolution. A call for liberation intended for the masses becomes an intellectual feast for the elite. The language of the problem, spoken in the raw dialect of suffering, is not the same as the language of the solution, written in the polished prose of critical theory.

The real challenge, I now understand, is not to write a more profound critique of the system. It’s not to find more stories of struggle and injustice. The real, near-impossible challenge is this: how do you write [a story](https://sparktsang.github.io/works.html) that even Neung, after reading it, would look up and say, "Yes. That is the world I want to live in"?

I don't have the answer. And in that humbling silence, the true journey begins.
