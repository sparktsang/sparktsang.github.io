Human connection is a strange and unpredictable thing. It can be loud and performative, a spectacle of shared laughter in a party hostel. Or it can be quiet, unfolding slowly in the hushed space of a guesthouse lobby, sparked by nothing more than a shared moment of stillness.

I first met Pierre in the dorm room. Our initial exchange was brief, a typical traveller's chat about plans and places. He'd been to Railay Beach; I had not. I was thinking of going to Trang; he didn't know where that was. We were two ships passing in the dorm, each navigating our own incomprehensible world. Our dialogue was a collection of disconnected points, a perfect metaphor for modern communication. 

The real conversation began later, in the common area. He saw me working on my laptop and, perhaps out of curiosity, sat nearby. I don't remember how it started, but he must have asked what I did for a living. I told him I was an investor, that I had achieved financial and temporal freedom, and that I was now trying to leave a small mark on the world, to make it a little better. I showed him my website, explaining its design, its philosophy, its revolutionary ambitions.

We talked about politics. I spoke of the troubles in Hong Kong. He spoke of France, a country not yet as polarized as America, he said, but "on the way." The far-right was rising, and the left was fractured, with no one to take the lead. "Most people don't think deeply," he mused, "they see a funny guy in a short video and they just follow." I agreed. The world was growing more populist, information more fragmented. We seemed to be losing our ability to reason with each other.

"I'm trying to change that," I said, then added with a self-conscious laugh, "It sounds crazy, but I want to start a revolution. A simple one, where we learn to make decisions based on reason, not just raw emotion." I invited him to look at the site and we exchanged contacts. His name was Pierre. He was in the middle of a gap year from his job in France—a concept that still surprised me—and had been traveling Southeast Asia for seven months, with five more to go. His grand plan was to travel overland from Laos into Yunnan, all the way to Beijing and the national park that inspired *Avatar*.

Then, his friends appeared. It turned out we were all sharing the same dorm, though I hadn't seen them. Arthur and Cyprien, each other’s classmates, were intrigued by my website. Arthur, learning about web development, was particularly enthusiastic. He sat down next to me, and we dove deep into the technicalities of my site, the theme I’d built on GitHub. He suggested MAMP as a development tool, and critiqued my font choices—<span style="font-family: Calibre">Calibre</span> and <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Times New Roman</span> would be better, he insisted. It was blunt, but I appreciated his honesty in a world where sincere opinions are a rarity.

"I'm going for an artistic effect," I explained. The conversation shifted to philosophy. He confirmed that all high school students in France study it for a year. "What do you think of Existentialism?" he asked. "Have you heard of Sartre?"

"Existence precedes essence," I replied.

His face lit up at our shared language. We spoke of Socrates, of his revolutionary act of questioning everything, of building arguments from a place of acknowledged ignorance. I explained how my own project was Socratic in spirit: [a system where all arguments could be heard](https://sparktsang.github.io/philosophy.html), not to see who was loudest, but to collectively find the best conclusion. He shared his own insights, how he tries not to judge people in the first ten seconds. He was 21, an engineering student on a six-month exchange at a university in Bangkok, using his long weekends to explore Thailand. He spoke of his dream to launch a start-up after graduation, maybe building automated farming robots to fight world hunger. "Millions of people are still starving," he said with a conviction that touched me. "It shouldn't be happening." 

As Arthur and I geeked out, Pierre was chatting with Cyprien. Soon, the conversation turned to my investment system, the very engine of my freedom. All three of them listened as I explained its philosophy, my critique of survivorship bias in fund management, my system’s foundation in causality rather than mere correlation. Pierre, older and more experienced, seemed to grasp the concepts most intuitively, even helping to explain a point to Cyprien. But it was the younger two who were most captivated.

After my passionate explanation, Pierre looked at me, his gaze steady, and asked a simple, devastating question: "Do you trust this?"

The question hung in the air. Was he asking if I trusted the system I had built, the one I had lived off for years? Or was he asking something deeper—if I trusted my entire worldview, this architect's belief that the world could be understood, deconstructed, and rebuilt into something better? I appreciated his frankness, but the question left me pondering the chasm between our ways of seeing the world.

A sudden downpour trapped us in the hostel. We were hungry. During a lull in the storm, I led them to a nearby restaurant I liked. Arthur ordered grilled chicken and sticky rice. "It looks delicious," I said. "It is," he replied. But moments later he felt unwell and excused himself. Cyprien then confided that Arthur hadn't actually liked the food but didn't want to disappoint me for my recommendation. It was a small, kind lie, but a poignant reminder of the invisible lines between us. We could share our dreams, but perhaps not our truths.

The three of us continued our deep talk. Pierre shared more travel stories and I again urged him to write them down. He demurred; he was a man who valued connection with the people around him more than broadcasting to the world. We talked of our hobbies. Pierre’s were diving, horseback riding, running. Cyprien joked that I should run more, especially in my HOKA shoes—a reminder that everything we wear defines us. I explained that for me, the line between work and hobby had dissolved; the things I did were the things I loved.

We drifted to our favourite films. *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button* for me, *Catch Me If You Can* for Pierre. I mentioned my desire to build a system where we could map our lives through the films we've watched, to see our own narratives reflected in the stories we love. "Do it," Pierre urged. 

As the night ended, Pierre brought out a notebook. On its pages were the names of every person he had met on his journey, a collection of souls organized by country. He asked us to add our names, and to recommend a favourite song in our native language for his travel playlist. It was, I observed, a form of stamp collecting. He agreed. He was building an archive against forgetting.

The next day, the dorm was empty when I woke. I found Pierre downstairs, lounging with his feet up, waiting for his bus to Bangkok. I asked him what his most unforgettable experience had been in his seven months of travel. He described a five-day trek into the Indonesian jungle, seeing wild animals, sitting around a campfire with new friends. I was curious. "Why come to Krabi?" I asked. For a man who loved jungles and adventure, Ao Nang seemed so… tame.

"A friend challenged me to come here and go rock climbing," he explained. "I'm completing challenges from friends." I had to ask. "Did you challenge them to challenge you?" He laughed. "Yes."

We fist-bumped goodbye. And in that moment, I understood the fundamental difference between us. My journey was an exploration of the human world; his was an escape from it. I wanted to challenge the system; he wanted to challenge himself within it.

I think of them often: Pierre, Arthur, and Cyprien. Three men from the heart of civilization, each seeking their own exit. Pierre escapes into memory, building a gentle fortress against the void. Arthur escapes into the future, hoping to mend a broken world with logic and technology. Cyprien escapes into the present, resisting indifference with pure curiosity.

And me? I don’t want to escape. I want to remake the world.

But the more I try, the more I see that we are all carrying our own shattered beliefs, trying to save pieces of a whole that has already been lost. Pierre’s question haunts me: "Do you trust this?" Trust, in our civilization, is no longer an emotion. It is a lost function. We are all trapped in systems we cannot believe in but must navigate—money, markets, algorithms. Trapped with a humanity we may have lost faith in.

My revolution is an attempt to rebuild that trust. Not a blind, religious faith, but a belief that we can still reason with each other, that we can weave a better world from the threads of our shared understanding. For a brief moment, on a rainy night in a hostel lobby in Krabi, four disparate souls—a romantic battling oblivion, an idealist battling chaos, an explorer battling apathy, and a revolutionary battling injustice—it felt, for just a moment, like the world could be changed by four people, a few conversations, and a storm.
