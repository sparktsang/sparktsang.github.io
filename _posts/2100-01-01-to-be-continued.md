The world does not reveal its secrets easily.

The stories you have just seen are not conclusions. They are beginnings. They are the first few scratches on the surface of a vast, complex, and often deceptive reality. Each one is a question mark, a loose thread, a piece of a puzzle that is infinitely larger than any single journey.

This project—this indictment—is not finished. It cannot be. As long as there are unwritten rules to uncover, phantom locks to expose, and moments of grace to be found on slow trains to nowhere, the work continues.

My journey is to keep pulling at these threads. Yours, should you choose to accept it, is to bear witness.


For now, this page serves as a promise. A promise that more evidence will be submitted. More data points will be collected. The story is not over.
