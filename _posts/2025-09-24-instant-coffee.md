It began, as so many things do, with a television. In my [empty hotel in Chumphon](https://sparktsang.github.io/life/2025/09/23/01-accountant-holiday.html)—a magnificent, three-star ghost ship where I was the solitary passenger—I found myself watching Thai TV ads. It was a nostalgic experience, a glimpse into a dying medium from a bygone era. A slickly produced commercial for something called "Super" instant coffee played on a loop, featuring a handsome, doe-eyed celebrity whispering the brand name in an ecstatic moan: *“Supeeeer~”*

The next day, in a local supermarket, I saw it. An entire promotional shelf, a monolith dedicated solely to this "Super" coffee. It was cheaper than the other brands. I picked up a bag, a casual act of consumer curiosity. And in that moment, I discovered something so simple, so obvious, that I was instantly consumed by a profound sense of shame for never having thought of it before.

I looked at the ingredients list. An instant 3-in-1 coffee mix contains three things: coffee, creamer, and sugar. But in what proportion? The label told the tale. Sugar: 46%. Creamer: 24%. And the actual, real, instant coffee powder? A mere 9.7%.

I stood there, stunned. A bag of coffee that was nearly half sugar. A coffee-flavored sugar slurry. I thought of how I make my own coffee; if I accidentally added that much sugar, I would pour it down the drain in disgust. I wanted to drink coffee, not syrup. The revelation was staggering. How many millions of consumers knew that what they were drinking was not, in any meaningful sense, coffee?

A wave of betrayal washed over me, followed by a hot flush of shame. I thought of the red-packaged brand of 3-in-1 I'd been drinking every morning for years on my travels. I, the self-proclaimed savvy consumer, had always chosen it because it offered the most grams for the price. I rushed to the coffee aisle. I found my brand. The coffee content: 11%. Barely better. My entire calculation, my years of "smart" purchasing, had been a lie. I had been optimizing for the total weight, completely ignoring the most crucial variable in the equation.

Then, a second blow. The same brand had a green-packaged version I'd always ignored because it seemed more expensive on a price-per-gram basis. But now, reading the fine print, I saw it was "extra rich," with a coffee content of 17%. A quick mental calculation revealed that on a price-per-actual-coffee-gram basis, *it* was the superior value. I had been buying the wrong product for years.

Armed with this new, painful knowledge, I gazed at the coffee aisle. It was a five-meter-long wall of 3-in-1 coffee mixes. Two hundred and forty different products, perhaps? Even if half were duplicates, it was a dizzying array. Each one a puzzle with four variables: number of sachets, grams per sachet, coffee percentage, and price. To find the true best value, you’d need a spreadsheet and half a day. Who does that? Who, in the history of grocery shopping, has ever done that?

This is our reality. This is the system we live in. A consumer, to make one single, rational choice about a bag of instant coffee, must first perform hundreds of calculations. And even then, the most crucial variable—the quality of that 11% or 17% of actual coffee powder—remains forever unknowable.

My mind began to race, replaying the countless consumer battles I had fought over the years, my desperate, exhausting quest to be a rational, ethical actor in an irrational system.

The Battle of the Mattress: I had armed myself with the consumer council's report, which shockingly revealed that the cheapest mattress was one of the best, while the most expensive ones were mediocre. I walked into the empty, no-frills store and bought the champion of value, a mattress that has served me flawlessly for years. I felt a sense of victory, but it was a hollow one. I had won not because I was smart, but because everyone else, flocking to the overpriced, inferior brands, was not.

The Battle of the Thermos: I needed a new one. This time, I ignored all marketing, all design awards, all celebrity endorsements. I focused on the one metric that mattered: heat retention, a standardized number (e.g., how many degrees it drops from 100°C in 6 hours). It took me *hours* of online research. The brands didn't want to compete on this. They hid this core function deep in their websites, burying it under an avalanche of meaningless fluff about patented lids and ergonomic designs. I found the winner, but the victory was exhausting.

The Battle of the Laptop: My quest for the best performance-per-dollar ratio. A seemingly simple goal that led me down an endless rabbit hole. An i7 is not always better than an i5; it depends on the generation. But even the generation is meaningless without knowing the model number, and the all-important suffix letter—a "U" for an underpowered, castrated version that can negate all other specs. The only way was to compare benchmark scores from objective review sites. But even then, the same CPU performs differently in different chassis with different cooling systems. You had to find benchmarks for the specific *model*. And even then, you had to statistically identify and remove outlier results from overclocked, modded machines. After weeks of obsessive research, I bought a machine that was likely a better value than what 99% of consumers would buy. But had I truly won? The victory felt Pyrrhic, the cost in time and mental energy astronomical.

A unique, almost incomprehensible sense of indignation filled me. I don't demand to be a world-class, perfect consumer. My standards are laughably low: I just want to be *reasonably rational*. I just want to be *basically ethical*—to vote with my money for the merchants who offer the best value, not the charlatans with the slickest marketing. Every baht spent is a vote that shapes the world, and I cannot accept my vote making the world worse.

And yet, here I was, defeated by a bag of instant coffee. A basic, fundamental error I had been repeating for years.

I looked at the 240 varieties of 3-in-1, arranged in their perfect, military-like formations. They seemed to be mocking me, a victorious army on parade. And I was the vanquished, my dignity, rationality, and ethics in tatters. I had once thought myself superior, a savvy consumer. Now I saw the truth. I was just as clueless as everyone else, only worse, because I had been arrogant enough to believe I wasn't.

Why had no one ever spoken of this? Why must a consumer solve a hundred math problems just to find out which coffee is the best deal? I thought of all the people I'd ever asked about their purchasing choices. They always had a reason, an explanation. They seemed so sure of themselves. But I knew, with a sudden, painful certainty, that 99% of them had no idea their coffee was mostly sugar.

And perhaps this is the system's ultimate triumph: to trap us in an illusion of choice, to make us believe we are informed, rational actors, when we are merely grabbing the shiniest box off the shelf. The best value, the highest quality—these things are buried, lost in an ocean of noise. If reason and value were allowed to win too easily, the entire system, which thrives on rewarding marketing over quality, would collapse.

But this thought, this chain of reasoning, was already irrelevant. Because everyone already thinks they know the truth. Or at least, they have a truth of their own. And in a world like that, what is the real truth worth?
