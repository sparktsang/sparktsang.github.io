Do not mistake this for a travel blog. What you are about to witness is not an escape, but an investigation.

The world is a crime scene, and these stories are the evidence.

Each entry is a field note from the front lines of a broken civilization. A decoded conversation. A dissected system. A fragment of truth excavated from the ruins of the everyday. I am not a tourist; I am a forensic philosopher, conducting an autopsy on the present.

These are not stories. They are data points for an indictment. They are the raw material for a constitution yet to be written. They are a dialogue with the ghosts of Orwell and Foucault, held not in a library, but at a dusty bus stop, a forgotten border, and in the cold silence of a 16-bed dorm.

This is the evidence submitted before the verdict. The trial of our era begins now.
