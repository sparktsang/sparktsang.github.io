## I. The Epistemic Constitution

Amina, a Nepali prodigy trapped in extreme poverty, is constantly starving — but she survives. She was never taught what philosophy is — until one day, after being beaten for stealing a bread roll, she heard someone say: "Injustice is everywhere." She did not understand the word. She searched for a book that could define it — and found one. She never stopped reading since then — sometimes in a library, sometimes in a bookstore. She read through all the great works of philosophy. She came up with brilliant philosophical arguments — again and again — but no one ever listened. One night, hungry and defeated, she whispered to herself: "It's not just me. The whole world is built to ignore truth." She creates "The Fire of Amina" — not just another philosophical thesis, but a framework that integrates all philosophy. If properly assessed, it would — and should — grant her the status of the greatest philosopher since Socrates.

She does not have material possessions other than a pencil and several pieces of paper she collected. Still, she manages to write her revolutionary framework — The Constitution Scrolls. Now, all she needs is a pair of eyes — capable of seeing truth. 

But how? She is a prodigy — yet no one ever honours a single request. Before she can achieve anything, she is starved to death. The Gatekeeper takes her only possessions. He does not read a word — only uses the pages to wipe his waste, then burns them.

This is not a tragedy. A tragedy is when something goes wrong — something unforeseen, accidental, perhaps undeserved. This is not wrong — it is designed. This is not failure — that is the world's rule. This is not sad — it is criminal. And it will happen again. To you. Unless something changes. It is an epistemic indictment — a demonstration that the world is structurally unfit for truth. She could not achieve anything, because she was not allowed to. She had to fight to get the physical means to contact people. She had to fight to get the knowledge about who to contact. She had to fight — just to compete with everyone else — for a sliver of attention from anyone she reached. She had to fight to get viewed, to get assessed, to get validated. Her truth was trapped behind ten thousand locked doors. Each bore a label: "No credentials." "Too long." "Too short." "Too poor." "Too unknown." "Too idealistic." "Too real." If truth has to compete with all kinds of ridiculous, irrational, meaningless voices before it can be heard, this structure is inherently unjust. If truth cannot reach us because of a wall, then the wall is guilty.

This is not merely about her. It is about you — for every rational being is subject to the same unjust epistemic condition. You are also imprisoned in the same structure. Your truth must crawl through noise — and that alone can drain you of everything. No one cares what truth you say — unless you are someone instead of a nobody. Who you are, and who you know, matters more than what you say. That's how the world works. Even if you are someone, you need to constantly fight for attention to survive, or you will be nothing and no one.  

Why is nonsense everywhere? Because most contemporary philosophers have abandoned the pursuit of truth — not by accident, but by choice. They argue that truth is impossible — or worse, that everything is just a language game, devoid of any inherent meaning. We live in the post-truth age not by accident — but by surrender. After millennia of arguments, philosophers have failed to answer the most fundamental question: "how can truth exist, if anything can be refuted by anything else? There are endless arguments — and no conclusions. So how can anyone still believe in truth?

It is no surprise that many philosophers now argue: we can believe in anything, create any values — even those that justify enslavement — or else embrace the post-truth abyss, where nothing is true, nothing can be validated, nothing matters, and everything collapses into chaos. This is how civilization collapses: into nihilism. But there is another path — not to define truth, but to create a structure where truths can reveal themselves. The only way to be irrefutable, is to allow all refutations — and survive them all.

The world did not merely fail Amina. It failed the very condition for truth to exist. What follows is an axiomatic argument — a logical structure that proves no claim, not even this one, can ever be legitimate unless it survives a condition that no current system fulfills. That condition is called the Epistemic Constitution.

A1. Knowledge is only possible if we know what we know.  
A2. Justice is only possible if we know what is just.  
A3. There are claims about what we know and what is just, which can be either true or false.  
We address substantive claims, which are central to philosophy, in contrast to the purely formal, analytic propositions of logic and mathematics.  
A4. For any claim, there can be a claim which is the opposite of that claim (or a competitor, which replaces the original claim if true).  
A5. To establish a claim to be true is to justify it. (Definition)   
A6. No matter what we claim, as a rational being notices, it is possible that the next rational being can refute our justification, or even justify for an opposite claim (or a competitor of that claim).  
A7. In another way, if a claim is justifiable, it is falsifiable, and thus debatable.  
A8. Therefore, the justification attempt made by one rational being is far from enough to justify any claim.  
A9. Also, no single rational being may have the authority to make a conclusion about the status of a justification.  
A10. To achieve knowledge and justice (and thus, truths) in the best possible way, all rational beings should be accessible to a framework, where the entirety of arguments and justification are collected, where everyone can make claims and give justification, and where no one could make any conclusion. It is the epistemic constitution, the ultimate truth generator.  
A11. Before achieving so, we cannot make any conclusion about anything.  
A12. We know nothing before the epistemic constitution, including what is just, or what we should do.  
A13. Knowledge is only possible with the constitution.  
A14. Justice is only possible with the constitution. 

For all kinds of theories:
1. Whatever you claim, do you claim your claim to be true? If not, you are just making some noise. Please proceed if yes. 
2. Do you accept that your claim could be established to be wrong? If not, you make yourself an outsider of philosophical discussion. Please proceed if yes. 
3. Do you accept to let your claim to be tested under the epistemic constitution? If not, again you are an outsider of philosophical discussion. If yes, you are welcome.
